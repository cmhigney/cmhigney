Current Project(s) I am working on:
- Eventure - Social Event Discovery App (Team Project - In Progress) [https://github.com/vpaulino26/Local-Event-Discovery-Social-Planner]
A mobile application built with FlutterFlow and Dart that helps users discover local events and coordinate plans with friends. The app combines event discovery, social networking, and shared calendar functionality in one place. Users can browse events, connect with friends, create group calendars, and coordinate attendance together, solving the common problem of scattered event information and difficult group planning.
- Current Focus: Building user authentication flow - signup, login, and account creation pages
- Tech Stack: FlutterFlow (visual builder), Dart (Flutter's programming language), Firebase (backend)
- My Role: Frontend development and UI/UX implementation
  

Planned Project(s):
- Network Security Monitor (Solo Project - Planning Phase)
A Python-based network intrusion detection system that I'm developing to strengthen my cybersecurity skills for defense industry roles. After researching network security fundamentals and studying how tools like Wireshark and Snort work, I'm building a packet analyzer that can detect suspicious activity like port scans and unusual traffic patterns. The goal is to create something that logs potential threats and helps me understand how network monitoring actually works in practice.

Planned Features:
- Real-time packet capture and analysis
- Detection of common attack patterns (port scanning, traffic anomalies)
- Threat logging with timestamps and details
- Basic dashboard showing network statistics

- Tech Stack: Python, Scapy (packet manipulation library)
- Learning Focus: Network protocols, threat detection algorithms, security logging
- Purpose: Hands-on learning for Security+ cert and defense/cybersecurity applications
